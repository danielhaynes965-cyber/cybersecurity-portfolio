# Cybersecurity Portfolio — Daniel Haynes (aka *Xenithu*)

This repository contains my cybersecurity and pentesting portfolio: hands-on labs, writeups, tools, scripts, and structured notes documenting my skill development across core security fundamentals, web security, and offensive security techniques.

> **Focus for 2026:** Linux, Python, web exploitation, TryHackMe → HTB progression, CTF prep, and foundational skills for an IT role in early 2027.

## 🔎 How This Repo Works

### CTF Writeups (`/ctf-writeups`)
Writeups from CTF competitions (picoCTF, DownUnderCTF, etc.). Each writeup 
covers the challenge, my approach, and the solution. Added from mid-2026 onward.

### Fundamentals (`/fundamentals`)
Quick-reference cheatsheets for core concepts — networking, Linux, web, 
cryptography, and more. Condensed, practical, and written in my own words.

### HackTheBox (`/htb`)
Machine writeups from HackTheBox, organised by tier. These will be more 
open-ended than THM — less guided, more personal methodology. Added from 
mid-2026 onward.

### Tools (`/tools`)
Small Python and Bash utilities built from scratch. Each tool includes comments, 
usage examples, and safety notes. Added as they're built.

### TryHackMe (`/tryhackme`)
Writeups and notes from TryHackMe rooms, organised by path. Each entry follows 
a consistent format: summary, key concepts, commands, personal takeaways, and 
references. Only rooms with meaningful content are included — not every room 
gets a writeup.
